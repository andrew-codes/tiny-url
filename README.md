# README

This repo supports multiple, inter-dependent projects across technology boundaries via using a mono-repo tool called Nx. I've included some brief, relevant notes that I'll link to from this README file.

> Ask me about how Nx is critical tooling for mono-repos and how it fits in with micro-services.
